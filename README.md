# dotfiles
my dotfiles, managed using `yadm`.  

#### contents
1. `zsh` setup, using `zim`  
2. `fish` setup (warning: probably unmaintained excluding serious issues as i have switched to zsh)  

#### requirements
zsh requirements:
- `zsh` (obviously)
- `zim` (*install this before the dotfiles so the defaults can be overwritten*)

fish requirements:
- `fish` (obviously)
- `fisher` (https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher)

#### installation
all:
1. download and install yadm (other dotfile managers may work, but are not supported)
2. clone this repo with yadm, and resolve conflicts
	`yadm clone https://github.com/Ruthenic/dotfiles`  
zsh:  
3. run `zimfw install`.  
fish:  
TODO  

you are done.
